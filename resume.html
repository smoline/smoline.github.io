      <h4><strong>Designed and directed training program for new hires:</strong>  Minimal technical training was provided on customer accounts and support procedures which led to a slow start in new employee technical support.  Authored and implemented the training program that allowed existing employees and new hires to train in each department.  <strong>Result:</strong>  Existing and new employees exhibited more confidence and consistency with each system supported.</h4>
